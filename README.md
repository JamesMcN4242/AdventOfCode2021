# AdventOfCode2021
Repository to hold and compare solutions from advent of code 2021. Initially I planned to complete the first week in different languages, but now that I've passed that mark I'd like to continue it up to 12 days. 12 days of Christmas? Nah. 12 days of coding experimentation.

Languages used per day so far:
1. Python (regret not saving this for later)
2. Rust
3. Java
4. Go (not sure why, but this language was insanely fun to use!)
5. Kotlin
6. Zig
7. Ruby
8. (Power)Shell
